      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Many people who play online games would like to play with a group of people, this is because most of the online games require groups of people to do certain activities inside the game and if they don’t do these activities they will be “behind” the others. A lot of gamers, especially those who aren’t professionals or devote long hours playing, have problems in being part or a team, sometimes they aren’t competitive enough to be with the “best players” or, the biggest problem, the time zone. Most of the famous games nowadays allow the gamers to play with everyone around the world, this is great, but it makes it hard to find a group who plays in the same hours that you. People who struggle to find players to play their favorite games will come to this web site to find partners to play with.

      <h3>Players' Rank</h3>
      <h4>Purposes</h4>
      <p>
        The visitors will be able to check out the games that the community is playing and the best time to meet with them and how to do it. The visitors will have an account and a profile where basic information will be displayed and this will allow the profile to receive “commends” or “reports” giving the players points that will rank him or her. Information like name, email, gender, age, favorite games, time zone and a brief introduction of the person’s characteristics will be necessary in order to build a profile. This web site will be a place where after you register, and with the user’s permission, other people will see the games that you play, the time that you play, how you play and what kind of friends are you looking for to play with. The user will be able to send a direct message inviting someone to play together. The site will also offer links to connect to other websites, like social medias and platforms that are usually used by the people who play games online. There will be a place to post experiences with pictures/screenshots to show how everyone is enjoying their games with their new friends.

      <h3>Games Played</h3>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <p>
        Playing games online with others sometimes can be very hard, there are toxic behaviors or trolls. The rank will be a place that everyone will receive credits for the good things they do and an excellent way to find and avoid playing with someone with bad manners, impatient or just annoying.  There will be a place where influencers or people who create content for live transmissions can show their work. This will be a perfect tool to spread the idea of the website and promote it. Every other week an influencer will be invited to be the week’s content creator who, supported by the website, will play a game with the website’s top rank players. People will be able to see how good these players are and how helpful they can be. The platforms who host the games or even the games developers will have a place to post promotions, events or updates of their games. The website will even collect articles from the platforms or games developers and share the content in an area designed to provide information of the games to the users. This will even be a good tool to attract new visitors since is very common for online games players to research about the content of their games on the internet. Of course, there will be areas designed to receive paid publicity from games related stores. The plan is that if the users of the website visit a store through a link in our website and purchase something, they will get especial discount.
